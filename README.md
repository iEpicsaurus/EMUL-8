A CHIP-8 Emulator by Team 15

Prior to compiling the program, you MUST install wxWidgets:

- To install wxWidgets, run the command "apt install libwxgtk3.0-dev"

Once you are done installing wxWidgets, you can compile using the makefile.

To open a ROM, open the program and select "Open ROM" from the "File" menu. A collection of public domain ROMs is provided in the repository.

The original control pad of the CHIP-8 looked like this: \
1 2 3 C \
4 5 6 D \
7 8 9 E \
A 0 B F

The corresponding key layout on a modern keyboard is: \
1 2 3 4 \
Q W E R \
A S D F \
Z X C V
